                Focus Form is an angular 1 directive that aims to present a basic vertical form, but provide distinct focus
                on the current 'section' to help the user complete the inputs. We don't care about the content you stick in
                the form. Put whatever you want in there, style it however you want. This directive is just about tracking focus
                as the user moves through the form.

            <focus-form-section name="Section 3">
                We do provide some default styling to highlight how the form works. This is something you can keep, or if you choose,
                you can just overwrite it with your own style. All of the default styles are applied via CSS, so they are
                easy to overwrite.
